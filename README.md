In this challenge we  need to build out this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The only assets we provide in this challenge are the image of the person in the app UI and the 3 images of the dog. We need to create everything else using HTML & CSS!

I build this challenge using Tailwind CSS.🚀
